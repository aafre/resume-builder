## 2024-05-23 - Destructive Action Patterns
**Learning:** Destructive icon-only actions (like remove buttons) in this codebase benefit from using `text-red-600` with `hover:bg-red-50` and `rounded` classes. This provides clear visual feedback and consistency.
**Action:** When implementing delete/remove actions, use this color palette and ensure `aria-label` is present.

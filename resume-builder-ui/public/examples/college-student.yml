customFaqs:
  - question: "How do I write a resume as a college student with no work experience?"
    answer: "Focus on education, academic projects, volunteer work, campus organizations, and relevant coursework. Use action verbs to describe accomplishments in these areas, and quantify results wherever possible (e.g., 'grew club membership by 40%'). A strong skills section listing technical and transferable skills also helps compensate for limited work history."
  - question: "Should I include my GPA on a college student resume?"
    answer: "Include your GPA if it is 3.0 or higher. If your major GPA is significantly higher than your cumulative GPA, you can list your major GPA instead (label it clearly). Once you have 2-3 years of work experience, GPA becomes less important and can be removed."
  - question: "What is the best resume format for a college student?"
    answer: "Use a reverse-chronological format with Education listed before Work Experience. This highlights your academic credentials first. Keep it to one page, use a clean ATS-friendly template, and include sections for Skills, Projects, and Activities to fill space meaningfully."
  - question: "How long should a college student resume be?"
    answer: "One page. Recruiters reviewing entry-level candidates expect concise resumes. If you are struggling to fill a page, add relevant coursework, academic projects, volunteer experience, or campus leadership roles. If you have too much content, prioritize the most relevant items for the position you are applying to."

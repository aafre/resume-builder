        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Success in an interview begins long before you walk into the room.
          Proper preparation is what separates a good candidate from a great

          Research the Company and Role Thoroughly
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          You must understand the company's mission, products, culture, and
          recent news. This shows genuine interest and helps you tailor your
          answers.

              <strong>Company Website:</strong> Read the "About Us," "Mission,"
              and "Products/Services" pages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>LinkedIn:</strong> Follow the company's page. Look at the

              role.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Recent News:</strong> Do a quick Google News search for
              the company. Are they launching a new product? Did they recently
              win an award? Mentioning this shows you've done your homework.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Job Description:</strong> Re-read it carefully.
              Understand the key responsibilities and required skills. Be

              each point.

          Prepare Your Stories with the STAR Method
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          For almost any question, especially "Tell me about a time when...",
          the STAR method is your best friend. It provides a clear, concise, and
          compelling structure for your answers.

              (e.g., "In my previous role as a project manager...")
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>T - Task:</strong> Explain your specific responsibility or
              goal. (e.g., "...I was tasked with launching a new marketing
              campaign on a tight budget.")
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>A - Action:</strong> Detail the specific steps *you* took
              to address the task. (e.g., "I analyzed customer data to identify
              our key demographic, then focused our ad spend on targeted social
              media platforms...")
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>R - Result:</strong> Quantify the outcome of your actions.

            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Prepare 5-7 strong STAR stories about your

            problem-solving.

        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          An interview is a two-way street. Asking thoughtful questions shows

          Your interview doesn't end the moment you step out of the room (or
          leave the call). How you close the conversation – and what you do if
          the employer follows up – can leave a lasting impression.
        </p>

        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-10 mb-4">
          1. Thank Them in the Moment
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          At the end of the interview, always thank your interviewers for their
          time. A simple and genuine:

        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          One of the best ways to stand out is to ask thoughtful questions
          during the interview, especially toward the close when they say, "Do

          4. Stay Patient and Balanced
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Hiring processes often take longer than expected. If they gave you a
          timeline and it passes, it's fine to check in once with the recruiter.
          Otherwise, avoid chasing – and keep applying for other opportunities
          in parallel.

        <div className="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-8">
          <p className="text-yellow-800 font-medium">
            <strong>💡 Reality Check:</strong> The best candidates don't put all
            their eggs in one basket. Continue interviewing elsewhere while you
            wait. This keeps you sharp and gives you options – which actually
            makes you more attractive to employers.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mt-8">
          Remember: interviews are conversations, not performances. The
          companies that are right for you will appreciate authenticity over
          perfection. Focus on being prepared, professional, and genuinely
          curious about the role and company.

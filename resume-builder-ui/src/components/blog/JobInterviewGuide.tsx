          Research the Company and Role Thoroughly
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          You must understand the company's mission, products, culture, and
          recent news. This shows genuine interest and helps you tailor your
          answers.
        </p>

              <strong>Company Website:</strong> Read the "About Us," "Mission,"
              and "Products/Services" pages.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>LinkedIn:</strong> Follow the company's page. Look at the
              profiles of your interviewers to understand their background and
              role.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Recent News:</strong> Do a quick Google News search for
              the company. Are they launching a new product? Did they recently
              win an award? Mentioning this shows you've done your homework.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>The Job Description:</strong> Re-read it carefully.
              Understand the key responsibilities and required skills. Be

              each point.

          Prepare Your Stories with the STAR Method
        </h3>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          For almost any question, especially "Tell me about a time when...",
          the STAR method is your best friend. It provides a clear, concise, and
          compelling structure for your answers.

            <li>
              <strong>S - Situation:</strong> Briefly describe the context.
              (e.g., "In my previous role as a project manager...")
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>T - Task:</strong> Explain your specific responsibility or
              goal. (e.g., "...I was tasked with launching a new marketing
              campaign on a tight budget.")
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>A - Action:</strong> Detail the specific steps *you* took
              to address the task. (e.g., "I analyzed customer data to identify
              our key demographic, then focused our ad spend on targeted social
              media platforms...")
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>R - Result:</strong> Quantify the outcome of your actions.

            <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Prepare 5-7 strong STAR stories about your
            biggest accomplishments, challenges you've overcome, and times
            you've demonstrated key skills like leadership, teamwork, and
            problem-solving.

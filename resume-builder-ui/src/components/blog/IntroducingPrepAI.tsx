          The Problem with Traditional Interview Prep
        </h2>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Most job seekers prepare for interviews by reading articles,
          memorizing answers, and maybe practicing in front of a mirror. While
          these methods have their place, they fall short in several critical
          areas:
        </p>

        <div className="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-xl p-6 my-6">
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-red-700">
            <li>
              <strong>No real-time feedback:</strong> You can't identify speech
              patterns, filler words, or areas for improvement
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Limited question variety:</strong> Static lists can't
              adapt to your industry or role
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No pressure simulation:</strong> Practicing alone doesn't
              replicate interview stress
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Generic advice:</strong> One-size-fits-all tips don't
              address your specific weaknesses
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Expensive alternatives:</strong> Professional coaching is
              costly and not always accessible
            </li>
          </ul>

          "Should I send a resume or a CV?" This is a common question that can
          trip up even experienced job seekers. While often used
          interchangeably, a <strong>resume</strong> and a <strong>CV (Curriculum Vitae)</strong> are
          distinct documents with different purposes, lengths, and content.
          Knowing which one to use for a particular application is crucial for
          your job search success.

            Submitting the wrong document can make you look unprepared or
            unprofessional. Always check the application requirements carefully
            to determine if a resume or CV is requested.

          What is a Resume?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          A <strong>resume</strong> is a concise, usually one-page (sometimes two, for more
          experienced professionals) summary of your skills, experience, and
          education, tailored specifically for the job you're applying for. Its
          primary goal is to provide a snapshot of your most relevant
          qualifications to quickly capture a recruiter's interest.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          A <strong>CV (Curriculum Vitae)</strong>, Latin for "course of life," is a
          detailed, comprehensive document that outlines your entire academic
          and professional history. Unlike a resume, a CV is typically longer,
          more extensive, and doesn't usually change much from one application
          to another.

            Even when asked for a CV internationally, if it's not an academic

            If you're unsure, it's safer to have both a resume and a CV
            prepared. Your <strong>resume</strong> should be a dynamic document that you
            adapt for every job. Your <strong>CV</strong> can be a more static, running
            record of your entire professional and academic life.

            By understanding these fundamental differences, you'll ensure you

            matter where you're applying.

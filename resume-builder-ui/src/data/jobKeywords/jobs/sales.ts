  roleIntro:
    'Sales is one of the most metrics-driven professions, and hiring managers screen for very specific language on resumes. Whether you are in inside sales, outside sales, enterprise, or SaaS, your resume needs to demonstrate quota attainment, pipeline management skills, and fluency with modern sales technology. ATS systems at companies like Oracle, Salesforce, and IBM filter candidates on CRM experience, methodology training, and quantifiable revenue impact before a human ever reads your application. This guide covers the exact keywords that pass those filters across every sales specialization — from SDR to VP of Sales.',

  commonMistakes: [
    {
      mistake: 'Not including specific quota or revenue numbers',
      fix: 'Always quantify: "$2.1M generated," "118% quota attainment," "32 deals closed." Numbers are the language of sales hiring — a resume without them gets filtered out immediately.',
    },
    {
      mistake: 'Using vague phrases like "exceeded expectations" or "top performer"',
      fix: 'Be specific: "Ranked #1 out of 42 reps," "122% of annual target," "$6.5M pipeline generated." Vague claims without proof are ignored by both ATS and hiring managers.',
    },
    {
      mistake: 'Not mentioning CRM or sales technology experience',
      fix: 'Name the exact tools — Salesforce, HubSpot, Outreach, Gong. Over 80% of sales job postings filter on CRM proficiency. "CRM experience" alone is not enough.',
    },
    {
      mistake: 'Listing only closing, not the full sales process',
      fix: 'Show end-to-end capability: prospecting → qualification → discovery → demo → proposal → negotiation → close → account management. This signals you can own the entire revenue cycle.',
    },
    {
      mistake: 'Omitting sales methodology training',
      fix: 'Include methodologies like MEDDIC, Challenger, SPIN, or Sandler. Many enterprise sales teams require specific framework fluency and ATS systems filter for these terms.',
    },
    {
      mistake: 'Ignoring retention and expansion metrics',
      fix: 'Modern sales roles value post-sale success. Include retention rates, NRR, expansion revenue, and customer satisfaction scores to show full-funnel impact.',
    },

  customFaqs: [
    {
      question: 'What are the most important keywords for a sales resume?',
      answer:
        'The most critical sales resume keywords are quota attainment, revenue generated, pipeline management, CRM (especially Salesforce or HubSpot), business development, consultative selling, and specific metrics like ARR, win rate, and conversion rate. Always match keywords to the specific job posting you are targeting.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I quantify sales achievements on my resume?',
      answer:
        'Use the formula: Action + Metric + Result. For example, "Generated $2.1M in new ARR (118% of quota)" or "Expanded 75-account portfolio revenue by 35% through upsell/cross-sell." Include quota attainment percentages, revenue numbers, deal counts, win rates, and ranking among peers.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I include my sales quota on my resume?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Including your quota and attainment percentage gives hiring managers immediate context. "118% of $2.4M annual quota" is far more impactful than "exceeded sales targets." If your company does not disclose exact quotas, use percentages and relative rankings instead.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What CRM skills should I list on a sales resume?',
      answer:
        'List the specific CRM platforms you have used — Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft Dynamics 365, Pipedrive, or Zoho. Go beyond just naming the tool: mention dashboards, reporting, pipeline management, and forecasting within the CRM. Salesforce proficiency appears in over 60% of B2B sales job postings.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do sales resume keywords differ between SDR and AE roles?',
      answer:
        'SDR resumes should emphasize prospecting, cold outreach, lead qualification, meetings booked, and pipeline generated. AE resumes should focus on full-cycle sales, quota attainment, revenue closed, deal size, negotiation, and account management. Both should include CRM and sales engagement tools.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What sales methodologies should I mention on my resume?',
      answer:
        'Include any formal methodology training: MEDDIC/MEDDPICC, SPIN Selling, Challenger Sale, Sandler, Solution Selling, or Miller Heiman. Enterprise sales teams specifically filter for these. If you have not been formally certified, mention that you "apply [methodology] principles" if you genuinely use the framework.',

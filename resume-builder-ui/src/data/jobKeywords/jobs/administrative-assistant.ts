  roleIntro:
    'Administrative assistants are the operational backbone of every organization, and hiring managers use ATS systems to filter for very specific competencies — from software proficiency (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace) to organizational skills (calendar management, travel coordination, expense reporting). Whether you are targeting an entry-level admin role, a senior administrative coordinator position, or an executive assistant role supporting C-suite leaders, your resume must demonstrate both technical tool fluency and the soft skills that keep offices running smoothly. This guide covers the 60+ keywords that pass ATS filters at companies from small businesses to Fortune 500 corporations.',

  commonMistakes: [
    {
      mistake: 'Being too vague — "handled administrative duties"',
      fix: 'Be specific: "Managed executive calendars for 5 C-suite leaders, coordinating 60+ meetings/week across 4 time zones in Outlook." Detail the scope, volume, tools, and stakeholder level.',
    },
    {
      mistake: 'Not listing specific software proficiency',
      fix: 'Name exact tools: "Microsoft 365 (advanced Excel — pivot tables, VLOOKUP, macros)," "Concur expense management," "SharePoint document libraries." ATS systems filter on specific product names, not generic terms like "computer skills."',
    },
    {
      mistake: 'Underselling the role as just "answering phones"',
      fix: 'Administrative professionals manage complex logistics, budgets, and executive relationships. Frame your work in business terms: "Coordinated $300K travel budget," "Supported 200-person office operations," "Managed vendor relationships across 15 suppliers."',
    },
    {
      mistake: 'Not differentiating between admin levels',
      fix: 'Clearly signal your level: entry-level admins emphasize data entry, filing, and reception. Executive assistants emphasize C-suite support, board preparation, confidential communications, and budget management. Use the right keywords for your target level.',
    },
    {
      mistake: 'Omitting quantifiable achievements',
      fix: 'Add numbers everywhere: "60+ meetings/week," "$300K expense budget," "10,000 files migrated," "22% cost reduction." Even administrative work can and should be quantified — volume, accuracy, savings, and efficiency improvements.',
    },
    {
      mistake: 'Ignoring soft skills that ATS systems actually filter for',
      fix: 'Include "confidentiality," "discretion," "time management," "multitasking," and "prioritization." These appear frequently in admin job postings and are genuine ATS filter terms, not generic filler.',

  customFaqs: [
    {
      question: 'What are the most important keywords for an administrative assistant resume?',
      answer:
        'The most critical admin resume keywords are Microsoft Office/365, calendar management, scheduling, executive support, data entry, office management, travel coordination, expense reporting, and specific tools like Outlook, SharePoint, and Concur. Always match keywords to the exact job posting — an executive assistant role and a front desk receptionist role require different emphasis.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I make an administrative assistant resume stand out to ATS?',
      answer:
        'Include specific tool names (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, Concur, SharePoint), quantify your scope (number of executives supported, meetings coordinated, budget managed), and mirror keywords from the job posting. Use a clean, single-column format with clear section headers that ATS can parse easily.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the difference between administrative assistant and executive assistant keywords?',
      answer:
        'Administrative assistants emphasize office operations, data entry, filing, customer service, and general office support. Executive assistants emphasize C-suite support, board meeting preparation, confidential communications, complex travel coordination, budget management, and strategic project support. EAs should include "executive assistant," "C-suite," and "chief of staff" keywords.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Should I list Microsoft Office proficiency levels on my resume?',
      answer:
        'Yes, but be specific. Instead of "proficient in Microsoft Office," write "Microsoft 365: Advanced Excel (pivot tables, VLOOKUP, macros, Power Query), Word (templates, mail merge), PowerPoint (executive presentations), Outlook (calendar management, rules)." Specific feature knowledge passes ATS filters and demonstrates genuine proficiency.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I quantify administrative assistant achievements?',
      answer:
        'Quantify everything: number of executives supported, meetings coordinated per week, budget managed, travel expenses processed, files organized, events planned, cost savings achieved, and efficiency improvements. "Coordinated 60+ meetings/week for 5 executives with 99% accuracy" is far more compelling than "managed calendars."',
    },
    {
      question: 'What certifications help an administrative assistant resume?',
      answer:
        'The Certified Administrative Professional (CAP) is the gold standard. Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS) certifications validate technical skills. Google Workspace Certification is increasingly valued. For executive assistants, project management credentials (CAPM or PMP) and Notary Public certification add significant value.',

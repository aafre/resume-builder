  roleIntro:
    'Marketing has become one of the most data-driven professions, and hiring managers now expect a blend of creative strategy and analytical rigor on every resume. Whether you specialize in digital marketing, content, product marketing, or brand management, your resume must demonstrate measurable campaign results and fluency with modern marketing technology. ATS platforms at agencies and in-house teams alike filter for specific tool names (Google Analytics, HubSpot, Marketo), channel expertise (SEO, PPC, email), and metrics (ROAS, CAC, conversion rate). This guide covers the exact keywords that pass those filters — from entry-level marketing coordinator to CMO.',

  commonMistakes: [

    },
    {
      mistake: 'Using outdated tool names or omitting specific platforms',
      fix: 'Name exact tools: "GA4" not just "analytics," "HubSpot" not just "marketing automation," "Ahrefs" not just "SEO tools." ATS systems match on specific product names.',
    },
    {
      mistake: 'Not differentiating between marketing specializations',
      fix: 'Tailor keywords to your focus area. A content marketer should emphasize SEO, editorial strategy, and organic traffic. A demand gen marketer should lead with MQLs, CPL, and pipeline attribution.',

      mistake: 'Ignoring the connection between marketing and revenue',
      fix: 'Modern marketing teams are measured on pipeline and revenue impact. Include metrics like pipeline-influenced revenue, SQL-to-close rate, and CAC payback period to show business impact.',
    },
    {
      mistake: 'Overemphasizing vanity metrics like followers or impressions',
      fix: 'Impressions and followers matter less than conversion metrics. Lead with CTR, conversion rate, CPL, ROAS, and revenue attributed — the metrics CMOs and VPs care about.',
    },

      question: 'What are the most important keywords for a marketing resume?',

        'The most critical marketing resume keywords are digital marketing, content strategy, SEO, demand generation, marketing automation (HubSpot, Marketo), Google Analytics, paid media management, and metrics like ROAS, CPA, and MQLs. Always tailor keywords to match the specific job posting — a content marketing role and a paid media role have different keyword priorities.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do I quantify marketing results on my resume?',
      answer:
        'Use specific numbers: "Grew organic traffic 450% to 85K monthly sessions," "Reduced CAC from $180 to $95 via channel optimization," "Generated 2,400 MQLs/quarter at $32 CPL." Pair every campaign or initiative with at least one measurable outcome: traffic, leads, conversion rate, revenue, or cost savings.',

      question: 'Should I list every marketing tool I have used?',
      answer:
        'List the tools most relevant to your target role, grouped by category. For a digital marketing role, prioritize analytics (GA4), automation (HubSpot), SEO (Ahrefs/SEMrush), and paid media (Google Ads). A "Tools" or "Technical Skills" section with 15-20 tools is typical for mid-to-senior roles.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How do marketing resume keywords differ between B2B and B2C roles?',
      answer:
        'B2B marketing resumes should emphasize demand generation, ABM, MQLs/SQLs, pipeline attribution, content marketing, and tools like HubSpot or Marketo. B2C resumes should focus on brand awareness, customer acquisition, ROAS, social media, influencer marketing, and platforms like Shopify or Klaviyo.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What marketing certifications are most valuable on a resume?',
      answer:
        'Google Analytics Certification and Google Ads Certification are near-universal requirements. HubSpot Inbound Marketing and Meta Blueprint are highly valued. For specialized roles, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, SEMrush SEO, or Hootsuite Social Marketing certifications add credibility and pass ATS filters.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How should I structure a marketing resume for ATS?',
      answer:
        'Use a clean, single-column layout with clear section headers: Summary, Experience, Skills/Tools, Certifications, Education. Include a "Core Competencies" or "Areas of Expertise" section near the top with 8-12 keyword-rich marketing skills. Mirror exact phrasing from the job posting wherever honest and accurate.',
